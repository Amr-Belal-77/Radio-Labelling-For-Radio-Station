# Radio Labelling For Radio Station
*“Taming the airwaves—one channel at a time.”*

## Overview

In an era where radio frequencies are more crowded than ever, interference from uncontrolled simultaneous transmissions can wreak havoc on communications. **Radio Labelling For Radio Station** offers a creative and robust solution to this challenge. By intelligently labelling radio channels, this project minimizes the interference that occurs when channels are too close, ensuring that each frequency delivers clear, reliable communication.

## The Challenge

Modern radio systems often suffer from interference when two nearby channels interact. Such interference can degrade signal quality and compromise the effectiveness of communication systems. This project addresses these issues by:
- Detecting potential interference between closely spaced channels.
- Assigning labels to channels in a way that minimizes their interaction.
- Ensuring optimal channel allocation to maintain the integrity of transmissions.

## Key Features

- **Interference Mitigation:** Implements a strategy to reduce the negative impact of simultaneous transmissions from neighboring channels.
- **Innovative Algorithm:** The core solution is detailed in the `Algo_Laxman.ipynb` notebook, where a custom algorithm labels radio channels to avoid overlapping interference.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** A thorough explanation of the methodology, theoretical foundations, and experimental results is available in the [Document Radio Labeling.pdf](https://github.com/Amr-Belal-77/Radio-Labelling-For-Radio-Station/blob/main/Document%20Radio%20Labeling.pdf).
- **User-Focused Design:** With an interactive Jupyter Notebook interface, users can easily experiment with the algorithm, adjust parameters, and observe its performance in real-time.
- **Adaptability:** The solution is designed to be flexible, allowing it to be tailored to various radio network configurations and interference scenarios.

## How It Works

1. **Channel Labelling:** The algorithm systematically assigns labels to radio channels based on interference risk and channel proximity.
2. **Interference Detection:** It identifies channels that are likely to interfere with one another and ensures that they are allocated distinct labels.
3. **Optimized Channel Allocation:** By intelligently labelling the channels, the system minimizes the chance of overlapping frequencies, ensuring robust and reliable communications.
